## Next Two Terms in the Sequence

**Sequence**: 2, 6, 12, 20, ...

**Next Two Terms**: 30, 42

### Explanation:

We notice the difference between terms increases by 2:
- 6 - 2 = 4
- 12 - 6 = 6
- 20 - 12 = 8
- 30 - 20 = 10
- 42 - 30 = 12

Alternatively, the pattern follows a quadratic formula:

**General term**: aₙ = n(n + 1)

Which gives us:
- a₁ = 1 × 2 = 2  
- a₂ = 2 × 3 = 6  
- a₃ = 3 × 4 = 12  
- a₄ = 4 × 5 = 20  
- a₅ = 5 × 6 = 30  
- a₆ = 6 × 7 = 42
